# Disclaimer
This plugin requires the **core** plugin which will **not** be released anytime soon...

You may still use it but it'll require some modifications.

Its not as simple as just installing it directly without needing some fixes, Some parts of the code is outdated and some parts **need** the **core** plugin for it to work...
